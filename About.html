          <p>I am currently working as a Consultant for Data Visualization and Analysis at World Bank's Climate Change Group. In my free time, I am working on data science projects that pique my interest and finding ways to make this website better. I want a more in depth understanding of deep learning, recommendation systems, machine learning and build data science projects that could bring about social impact.</p>
          <p> I have recently completed my Masters of Science in Analytics with concentration in Data Science from Georgetown Univeristy. 
              I completed my BA in Mathematics and Economics from Cornell College in May 2016 with <i>magna cum laude</i>.</p>
              <p>After my BA, I worked as a Research Assistant at Univeristy of Iowa, to find associations and trends between commonly misdiagnosed diseases and socio demographic information from Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's data. And after graduating from Georgetown, I worked as a Data Analyst at American Urological Association. During this time, I worked on a project to find out whether there's any associations between opioid use, kidney stone and other socio demographic data using the survey data from Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.</p>
            <p>I want to use data science to bring impactful changes in the society, such as income equality, equal healthcare access and climate change, and bring insight into human behaviors. I also enjoy using different visualization tools to tell stories.</p>
           <p> I'm using this website to display some of the fun visualizations that I have done and projects that I have worked on.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy finding interesting, fun math facts, reading, listening to podcast and traveling. So far, I have been to 18 states in the US. And I have exceeded my goal to read 52 book this year and I still can't stop reading. </p>
